# Introduction

This repository is developed to make use of the [mysqldiff utility](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.6/en/mysqldiff.html) to provide a [skeema-like](https://github.com/skeema/skeema) "file v.s. livedb" schema sync support across Windows, Linux and OSX.  



# Status of development and maintenance 

By far it's for leisure and personal convenience so don't expect much, I'll try my best to update codes and this README though. 


# Usage

Just run 
```
user@proj-root> node /index.js --help
```
and you'll find out.
